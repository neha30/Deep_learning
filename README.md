## Difference between Keras, Tensorflow and PyTorch

Most popular libraries in descending order are:

    1. Tensorflow
    2. Keras
    3. PyTorch
    4. Theano: Lost popularity because of no support and maintanance.
    
## Keras v/s PyTorch v/s Tensorflow

Tensorflow is the most popular Deep Learning Library, is developed by Google.

PyTorch is a cousin of Lua-based Torch framework,and is strong competitior to tensorflow.

Keras is easy to learn and because of that gain popularity. Syntactic simplicity.
